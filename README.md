## Week 45 - Reliable Microservices

The following mitigations have been implemented: 

**Healthchecks** for monitoring the health of each microservice.
By adding condition:service_healthy in the depends_on section of a microservice in docker-compose.yml, 
it is guaranteed that the "depender" microservice does not start before the "dependee" microservice is healthy.  

**ocelot.json Rate Limits and Circuit Breakers** for limiting requests per user and protecting against abuse.
In *ocelot.json*, QoSOptions are used for configuring circuit breakers and retries. 
```
    {
        "RateLimitOptions": {
            "ClientWhitelist": [],
            "EnableRateLimiting": true,
            "Period": "1m",
            "PeriodTimespan": 60,
            "Limit": 100
        },
        "QoSOptions": {
            "ExceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking": 3,
            "DurationOfBreak": 10000,
            "TimeoutValue": 5000
        }
    }
```

**ApiGateway Retry Logic, Circuit Breaker and Fallback Logic**
In *Program.cs* ï¿½n ApiGateway, Polly is being added to handle transient failures with retry, circuit breaker, and fallback policies. 
And Ocelot is being configured to use the HttpClient "OcelotHttpClient" that has been configured with Polly policies.  
```
    builder.Services.AddHttpClient("OcelotHttpClient")
        .AddTransientHttpErrorPolicy(policyBuilder => 
            policyBuilder.WaitAndRetryAsync(3, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500)))
        .AddTransientHttpErrorPolicy(policyBuilder =>
            policyBuilder.CircuitBreakerAsync(5, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)))
        .AddPolicyHandler(Policy<HttpResponseMessage>.Handle<HttpRequestException>()
            .FallbackAsync(async cancellationToken =>
            {
                return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK)
                {
                    Content = new StringContent("{\"message\": \"Service temporarily unavailable\"}",
                        Encoding.UTF8, "application/json")
                };
            }));

    builder.Services.AddOcelot(builder.Configuration).AddPolly();
```

**TimelineServiceHttpClient for Retry Logic and Circuit Breaker**
The HttpClient in TimelineService that sends requests to UserManagementService and to PostManagementService in order to create the user feed
is configured with Polly policies as well.
```
    builder.Services.AddHttpClient("TimelineServiceClient")
        .AddTransientHttpErrorPolicy(policyBuilder => policyBuilder.WaitAndRetryAsync(3, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500)))
        .AddTransientHttpErrorPolicy(policyBuilder => policyBuilder.CircuitBreakerAsync(5, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)));
```

## Week 46 - Kubernetes

**Steps I have done to setup Kubernetes for the Twitter System:**

- CI/CD pipeline in Github Actions that builds the projects and pushes them to Docker Hub
- k8s.yml-files for each microservice including ApiGateway
- ApiGateway service is exposed on port 80 and port-forwarded to localhost:5000 using ```kubectl port-forward service/api-gateway 5000:80``` 
  so requests from Postman can be sent to the same url as before setting up Kubernetes. 

**Setup: Kubernetes Dashboard**

First apply the following YAML file to create the Kubernetes Dashboard:

```kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml```

Create service account and grant privileges:

```kubectl create sa webadmin -n kubernetes-dashboard``` 

```kubectl create clusterrolebinding webadmin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kubernetes-dashboard:webadmin```

Get the token for the service account:

```kubectl create token webadmin -n kubernetes-dashboard```

Run the following command:

```kubectl proxy```

Open the following URL in your browser:

http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/

Use the token to login.



## Week 48 - Design Patterns

I have decided to implement a sidecar pattern using Fluent Bit which is a fast, lightweight, and highly scalable logging, metrics, and traces processor and forwarder. 
Logs from multiple microservices are collected and written to separate log files within a shared directory for a easy monitoring. The logs are parsed a JSON for a structured and easy analysis.
